## About
**American Standards** were a chaotic hardcore / mathcore band from **Phoenix, Arizona (2011–2025)**.  
Blending metallic hardcore aggression with punk urgency and metalcore precision, the band became known for explosive live shows, raw personal lyrics, and a relentless DIY ethic.  
Their final LP, *Future Orphans* (2025), cemented their role as a cornerstone of Arizona’s heavy underground.
